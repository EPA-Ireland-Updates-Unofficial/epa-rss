The Facility Manager, or suitably qualified deputy&nbsp;was not present at the commencement of the site visit. This appears to be common practice. Although the Agency is not the Fire Authority, the inspectors noted serious&nbsp;issues of concern relating to fire&nbsp;prevention, detection and control. Alarmingly, a&nbsp;fire risk assessment report previously completed by the licensee and submitted to the Agency highlights similar fire safety risks. This matter will be referred to the Fire Authority.</p>\\n<p>Inadequate waste acceptance, handling and&nbsp;storage practices were observed, including failure to provide and maintain adequate Waste Inspection and Quarantine Areas. The licensee continues to allow unauthorised public access to the facility, resulting in unsuitable wastes being accepted and processed at the facility increasing the risk of fire and emissions of environmental significance. Unauthorised mechanical waste processing equipment continues to be operated on site, and the licensee persists with the unauthorised disposal and storage of waste both inside and outside the licensed site boundary despite previous Agency instruction to cease. These issues, as well as a number of other non-compliances and observations are&nbsp;detailed in the report.</p>\\n<p>The issues raised require action to be taken by the Licensee as specified in this report. The Licensee is required to submit a response to the non-compliances raised in this site visit report within 21 days of the date of issue of this report (using the 'Make a Response' link on the Site Visit page in EDEN), as outlined in the Follow-up Actions section of this report.</p>\\n<p>The Licensee is reminded that failure to comply with any condition attached to a licence or revised licence is an offence.</p>\"", \""announced\"": \""No\"", \""visittype\"": \""OEE\"", \""instigated_by\"": \""Intelligence Led\"", \""sampletaken\"": \""No\"", \""odourassessment\"": \""No\"", \""adourassessmentcompliant\"": \""N/A\"", \""licence_regno\"": \""W0214-01\"", \""profile_number\"": \""W0214\""}""}"

A programme of ancillary works connected with the overall upgrade project is also being progressed with most completion dates falling within 2025.</p>\\n<p>A summary of plant performance was given. U&Eacute; are aiming for 104 compliance samples to be taken during 2025. 10 no. samples records were recorded in the Q1 Update under compliance investigation (CI000025). &nbsp;Compliance results were unavailable for the first three weeks of January. This was attributed to operational reasons (plant shutdowns) and management changeover. It is U&Eacute;&rsquo;s intention to make up the shortfall to 104 compliance samples over the year. It was acknowledged that there is a risk that TN and TP average limits may not be achieved this year. U&Eacute; expect that performance will improve across all parameters once remaining upgraded SBR blocks come back on-line and as average air temperatures increase through the year. U&Eacute; confirmed that higher than expected load on the plant (2.17 PE in 2024) was expected to continue increasing in 2025 and is also affecting treatment performance.
