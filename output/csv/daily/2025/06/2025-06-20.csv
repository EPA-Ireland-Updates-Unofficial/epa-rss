U&Eacute; are aiming for 104 compliance samples to be taken during 2025. 10 no. samples records were recorded in the Q1 Update under compliance investigation (CI000025). &nbsp;Compliance results were unavailable for the first three weeks of January. This was attributed to operational reasons (plant shutdowns) and management changeover. It is U&Eacute;&rsquo;s intention to make up the shortfall to 104 compliance samples over the year. It was acknowledged that there is a risk that TN and TP average limits may not be achieved this year. U&Eacute; expect that performance will improve across all parameters once remaining upgraded SBR blocks come back on-line and as average air temperatures increase through the year. U&Eacute; confirmed that higher than expected load on the plant (2.17 PE in 2024) was expected to continue increasing in 2025 and is also affecting treatment performance. Issues with the aeration system in the Capital Upgrade treatment block were also cited as a compounding factor in treatment performance and should be resolved by end April 2025.</p>\\n<p>The EPA instructed Uisce &Eacute;ireann to carry out all actions necessary to comply with the waste water discharge licence.</p>\"", \""licenceid\"": \""4ab24fc5-2bf8-4aa8-ad9e-f4f68c559186\"", \""originalmeetingid\"": \""0d83b2ed-7614-f011-a373-0050568a2d1a\"", \""organisationname\"": \""Uisce \\u00c9ireann\""}""}"
