This cost tally also shows the volume removed from site from the interceptor.\\r\\nInterceptor: This point represents the last point to take a sample before the system discharges into the river. From this interceptor, the water flows to an underground sump where the pH is constantly monitored and recorded.   When the pH is within the limits, water flows into the nearby river. If the pH goes out of this range, a valve to the river automatically closes and an alarm in the security hut is activated. Water from this sump can be pumped to the WWTP, where it can be treated before discharge.\\r\\n\\r\\n3.Retention Drains:\\r\\n-These drainage channels lead directly to our neutralisation tank, which has a capacity of 10.2 m3. This is pumped to one of our holding tanks of 50m 3 each.\\r\\n-The last deep cleaning was in January 2025.\\r\\n-A restructuring of the retention drains, where materials are issued, returns and waste, is planned. In process of internal review.\\r\\n\\r\\n4.Update of the Site Plan, Foul, Process Drains\\r\\nAll our process waste from the synthesis plant, finishing plant and the labs goes to T13 (Neutralising Tank) and then to HT-1 & HT-2 (Holding Tanks) prior to release to the on-site foul sewer via F3. This then leads via F4 & F5 to the emission point WW-D1 (public foul sewer -not the river) on the southern boundary of the site.  As shown in the blue line on the plan.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould you require additional information please do not hesitate to contact us.\\r\\n\\r\\nKind Regards.\\r\\nGuillermo Vega \\r\\n\"", \""documentcategory\"": null, \""complianceinvestigationid\"": null}""}"

The SCADA system showed the venturi pumps as running but the speed was at 0hz (set point 48hz). The venturi pumps assist the surface aerators in the DO levels in the SBR tanks. To note, surface aerators in each SBR were still operational, providing a degree of aeration while the venturi pumps tripped. Electrical contractors attended site on Monday the 19/05/2025 and were able to bring one of the venturi pumps (in SBR 2) back on- line at this time. On the 20/05/2025 contractors were able to by-pass a relay to bring the venturi pump in SBR 1 back online. A spare relay part will be required for SBR 1 venturi, to take it out of bypass mode.  Both venturi pumps are both back operational with operations at the plant to remain under review. To note, a compliance effluent sample dated the 08/05/2025 yielded compliant results; pH 8.0, ammonia 0.35, Ortho-P 0.66, BOD <2, COD 27, TSS 3 and TP 0.62. Once available, process monitoring results to be provided where available. Operations will continue to be monitored on site with a further update to be provided when available.

This was identified by a damp patch on the roadway which was initially mistaken as a potable water leak.  The WWPS was shut off to reduce sewer escaping the closed system. A contractor was called out to carry out the repair and this was completed by 20.15 on 19/05/2025. As this is such a small catchment there was no need to tanker loads away as there was a enough holding space within the wet well of the WWPS for the short time the broken rising main was being fixed. Roadway was washed and disinfected after works.   \"", \""otherrelevantinformation\"": null, \""impactonenvironment\"": \""none\"", \""activityinprogress\"": \""Normal \"", \""dischargedetails\"": \""Underground/roadway leak close to Mooretown/Oldtown WWPS, https://maps.app.goo.gl/d2Dt9FL8CNRYCqP27.\""}""}"

U&Eacute; are aiming for 104 compliance samples to be taken during 2025. 10 no. samples records were recorded in the Q1 Update under compliance investigation (CI000025). &nbsp;Compliance results were unavailable for the first three weeks of January. This was attributed to operational reasons (plant shutdowns) and management changeover. It is U&Eacute;&rsquo;s intention to make up the shortfall to 104 compliance samples over the year. It was acknowledged that there is a risk that TN and TP average limits may not be achieved this year. U&Eacute; expect that performance will improve across all parameters once remaining upgraded SBR blocks come back on-line and as average air temperatures increase through the year. U&Eacute; confirmed that higher than expected load on the plant (2.17 PE in 2024) was expected to continue increasing in 2025 and is also affecting treatment performance. Issues with the aeration system in the Capital Upgrade treatment block were also cited as a compounding factor in treatment performance and should be resolved by end April 2025.</p>\\n<p>The EPA instructed Uisce &Eacute;ireann to carry out all actions necessary to comply with the waste water discharge licence.</p>\"", \""licenceid\"": \""4ab24fc5-2bf8-4aa8-ad9e-f4f68c559186\"", \""originalmeetingid\"": \""0d83b2ed-7614-f011-a373-0050568a2d1a\"", \""organisationname\"": \""Uisce \\u00c9ireann\""}""}"
